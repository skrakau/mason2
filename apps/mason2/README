STRUCTURAL VARIANT SIMULATION

The simulation of structural variants (SVs) is very limited.  Currently, SV
are simulated non-overlapping.  This means that if there is an inversion of
[b,e) in the genome then there is no SV within this interval.  The same is
true for SV indels.  However, there can be SNPs or small indels in this
region.  For translocation or duplications, if there is a translocation of
[a,b) to c then there will be no additional SV between the left and right end
of the source and desination.

There will be no overlapping small indels simulated with the breakends of SVs
and no indel in the bases adjacent to the breakend.  There is at least one
base between two breakends.
