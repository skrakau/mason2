COORDINATE SYSTEM TRANSLATION
-----------------------------

Two-step projectin; (1) original system, (2) small variants, (3) large
variants.

Small variants and large variants are independent of each other and cannot
overlap.  Even more at least one base difference.

Original to Large Variants
--------------------------

* (1) apply small variants (2) apply structural variants if any.

* use journal entries for translation of borders of structural variants

* data structures:

  - journal entries for (1->2)
  - interval tree for (2->3) with attached SV

Large Variants to Original
--------------------------

* (1) translate back from large variants to small variants CS, (2) translate
  into original CS.

* data strucutres:

  - interval tree for (3->2)
  - journal entries for (2->1)

QUERIES
-------

* given a read interval from the simulated donor genome, find all breakpoints
  (+start/end points) in the read

* given a read interval from the simulated donor genome, find all the
  locations of the breakpoints (+start/end points) in the original genome.
