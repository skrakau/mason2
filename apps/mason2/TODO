Mason 2 TODOs
=============

URGENT
------

mason_sequencing2 (IN: genome.fa genome.vcf [genome_meth.fa])

 * contig-wise VCF import, to interval trees
 * FASTQ input from a typical run for quality and N-patterns, cycle through data
 * SAM from original without SVs
 * SAM from original with indel SVs
 * SAM from original with other SVs, clip after left part

IMPORTANT
---------

 * use heap/tournament tree for merging in FastaJoiner
 * simulation of BS-seq reads
 * color-space data
 * parallelization of mason_fragments and mason_sequencing2

LATER
-----

 * exceptions instead of return codes
 * splicing given GFF/GTF file, use algorithm scaffold from ngs_roi
 * simulation from splicing data, spliced SAM as gold output
 * add simulation of adaptors/barcodes
 * PacBio read error models?
 * different quality scales
 * more robust parsing of VCF for variant import
