Mason 2 TODOs
=============

URGENT
------

mason_simulator

 * projection of alignments to the reference sequence.
   * realignment of single-end
   * add test for single-end with SVs
   * all of paired-end
 * FASTQ input from a typical run for quality and N-patterns, cycle through data
   - This requires bulk-simulation of reads to circumvent possible problems.

IMPORTANT
---------

 * use heap/tournament tree for merging in FastaJoiner
 * color-space data
 * testing, FASTQ profiles etc.
 * splicing given GFF/GTF file, use algorithm scaffold from ngs_roi
 * joining of FASTA files uses lexical comparison not natural number order

LATER
-----

 * exceptions instead of return codes
 * add simulation of adaptors/barcodes
 * PacBio read error models?
 * different quality scales
 * more robust parsing of VCF for variant import
