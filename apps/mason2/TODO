Mason 2 TODOs
=============

URGENT
------

mason_simulator

 * written quality profiles weird, maybe also errors?
 * contig-wise VCF import, to interval trees
 * SAM from original without SVs
 * SAM from original with indel SVs
 * SAM from original with other SVs, clip after left part
 * FASTQ input from a typical run for quality and N-patterns, cycle through data

IMPORTANT
---------

 * use heap/tournament tree for merging in FastaJoiner
 * simulation of BS-seq reads
 * color-space data
 * testing, FASTQ profiles etc.

LATER
-----

 * exceptions instead of return codes
 * splicing given GFF/GTF file, use algorithm scaffold from ngs_roi
 * simulation from splicing data, spliced SAM as gold output
 * add simulation of adaptors/barcodes
 * PacBio read error models?
 * different quality scales
 * more robust parsing of VCF for variant import
